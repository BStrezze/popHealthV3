Code Path:
	app->assets->javascripts->views->dashboard.js.coffee
		This is the main view to the page - the rest are effectively sub views
		
	app->assets->javascripts->models->category.js.coffee
		This defines the Category class, which has a Measures collection
		
	app->assets->javascripts->models->measure.js.coffee
		This defines the Measure class, which has a SubMeasures collection. It also contains the definition of a SubMeasure
		The SubMeasure class seems to create a Query object, which i think calls the create method in the QueryController, as that send the SubMeasure request to the Quality Measure Engine
		The values passed are:
			measure_id
			sub_id (SubMeasure ID)
			effective_date

	app->assets->javascripts->models->query.js.coffee
		This class looks to create/populate the Query object, which *I think* is sent to the QueryController.
		It also looks like this class does the percentage calculations, etc.

	<***** SPECIAL SAUCE TO SEND REQUEST FROM CLIENT TO SERVER (in other words, no idea what happens) *****>

	app->controllers->api->queries_controller.rb
		This class sends the actual requests over to the Quality Measure Engine.
		The method used for the SubMeasure request is the "create" method. This calls the QME::QualityReport.find_or_create method.


SubMeasure query options
{
	:filters=>{
		:providers=>["53aae22cd3df6b2398002144"]

	:effective_date=>1401642895, 
	"prefilter"=>{
		"birthdate"=>{
			"$lte"=>802026895, 
			"$gte"=>-1312267505

		}
	}


This is a returned value from the QueryController->create method
